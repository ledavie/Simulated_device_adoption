Market Adoption Dashboard Prototype

This project is an interactive, single-page data visualization dashboard built using Streamlit and Plotly. 
  It serves as a proof-of-concept for the analytical and reporting capabilities required by a Professional Services / Data Analyst role in a MedTech company.

The goal is to transform simulated raw procedure data into actionable commercial
  insights regarding the adoption, growth, and market concentration of a new medical device.

  Technology Stack

Primary Language: Python

Web Framework: Streamlit (for quick prototyping and interactive UI)

Visualization: Plotly Express (for rich, interactive charts)

Data Handling: Pandas (for data ingestion, cleaning, and metric calculation)

 
 Setup and Running the Dashboard

1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed, then install the necessary libraries:

    pip install streamlit pandas plotly

2. Data File Placement

The application expects the simulated data file to be located in a specific folder structure:

File Name: device_adoption_data.csv

Required Path: ~/Desktop/Simulated_device_adoption/device_adoption_data.csv
(The script uses os.path.expanduser("~") to find your home directory dynamically.)

3. Execution

Save the dashboard code as market_adoption_dashboard.py and run it from your terminal:

    streamlit run market_adoption_dashboard.py

The application will automatically open in your web browser.
